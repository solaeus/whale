# Whale

Whale is a data-oriented programming language and interactive shell. The
command-line interface can also be run as a singular command or it can run a
file. Whale is minimal, easy to read and easy to learn by example. Your code
will always do exactly what it looks like it's going to do.

A basic whale program:

```whale
output "Hello world!"
```

Whale can do two things at the same time:

```whale
async (
    'output "will this one finish first?"',
    'output "or will this one?"'
)
```

Wait for a file to change, then print the time:

```whale
watch "foo.whale";
output "The time is " + local_time();
```

## Features

### Powerful macros

Built-in tools called **macros** reduce complex tasks to plain, simple code.

```whale
download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/cast"
```

### Pipelines

Like a pipe in bash, zsh or fish, the yield operator `::` evaluates the expression
on the left and passes it as input to the expression on the right. That input is
always assigned to the **`input` variable** for that context. These expressions
may simply contain a value or they can call a macro or function that returns
a value.

```whale
download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/cast"
  :: output(input)
```
 
### Format conversion

Effortlessly convert between whale and formats like JSON, CSV and TOML.

```whale
download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/cast"
  :: from_json(input)
  :: to_csv(input)
```

### Structured data

Unlike a traditional command line shell, whale can represent data with more than
just strings. Lists, maps and tables are everywhere in whale. When you pull in 
external data, it is easy to deserialize it into whale.

```whale
download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/cast"
  :: input:from_json()
  :: input:get(0)
  :: input.name
```

### Package management

Whale integrates the [DNF] package manager, so you can use whale to manage
installed packages on any system with DNF installed. DNF is a safe and reliable
package manager with distinct repositories for free and non-free software.

```whale
install_package (
  "bat",
  "fzf",
  "lsd"
)
```

### Disk Management

Whale scripts are clear and easy-to-maintain. You can manage disks with sets of
key-value pairs instead of remembering positional arguments. Under the hood,
whale passes these arguments to GNU's [parted].

```
new_disk.name = "My Files"
new_disk.filesystem = "btrfs";
new_disk.path = "/dev/sdb";
new_disk.label = "gpt";
new_disk.range = (0, 8000);

new_disk:partition();
```

### First-Class Functions

Assign custom functions to variables. Functions can return any value or none at
all. Use functions to build structured data or automate tasks.

```whale
User = '
  this.name = input.0;
  this.age = input.1;
  this
';

user_0 = User("bob", "44");
user_1 = User("mary", "77");
```

This "fetch" function will download JSON data and parse it.

```
fetch = '
  raw_data = download(input.0);
  from_json(raw_data)
';
```

## Usage

Whale is in pre-alpha and under active development. At this stage, features come
and go and the API is always changing. It should not be considered for serious
use yet.

## Installation

You must have the default rust toolchain installed and up-to-date. Clone the
repository and run `cargo run` to start the interactive shell. To see other
command line options, use `cargo run -- --help`.

## The Whale Programming Language

Whale is a hard fork of [evalexpr]; a simple expression language. Whale's core
language features maintain this simplicity. But it can manage large, complex
sets of data and perform complicated tasks through macros. It should not take
long for a new user to learn the language, especially with the assistance of
the shell.

### Variables and Data Types

Variables have two parts: a key and a value. The key is always a text string.
The value can be any of the following data types:

- string
- integer
- floating point value
- boolean
- list
- map
- table
- function
- time
- empty

Here are some examples of variables in whale.

```whale
x = 1;
y = "hello, it is " + now().time;
z = "42.42";

list = (3, 2, x);
big_list = (x, y, z, list);
```

### Macros

**Macros** are whale's built-in tools. Some of them can reconfigure your whole
system while others are do very little. They may accept different inputs, or
none at all. Macros in the `random` group can be run without input, but the
`random_integer` macro can optionally take two numbers as in inclusive range.

```whale
die_roll = random_integer(1, 6);
d20_roll = random_integer(1, 20);
coin_flip = random_boolean();
```

The **method operator `:`** offers an alternate syntax for passing variables to
macros and functions. Like calling methods in object-oriented languages, the
variable name on the left is passed as the first argument to the macro or
function on the right. You can pass more values using the syntax shown above.

```whale
message = "I hate whale";
message:replace("hate", "love");
```

### Lists

Lists are sequential collections. They can be built by grouping values with
parentheses and separating them with commas. Values can be indexed by their
position to access their contents. Lists are used to represent rows in tables
and most macros take a list as an argument.

```whale
list = (true, 42, "Ok");

assert_eq(list:get(0), true);
```

### Maps

Maps are flexible collections with arbitrary key-value pairs, similar to JSON
objects. Under the hood, all of whale's runtime variables are stored in a map,
so, as with variables, the key is always a string.

```whale
reminder.message = "Buy milk";
reminder.tags = ("groceries", "home");

json = reminder:to_json();
json:append("info.txt");
```

### Tables

Tables are strict collections, each row must have a value for each column. Empty
cells must be explicitly set to an empty value. Querying a table is similar to
SQL.

```whale
animals.all = create_table (
    ("name", "species", "age"),
    ("rover", "cat", 14),
    ("spot", "snake", 9),
    ("bob", "giraffe", 2),
);
```

The macros `create_table` and `insert` make sure that all of the memory used to
hold the rows is allocated at once, so it is good practice to group your rows
together instead of using a call for each row.

```whale
animals.all:insert(
    ("eliza", "ostrich", 4),
    ("pat", "white rhino", 7),
    ("jim", "walrus", 9)
);

assert_eq(animals:length(), 6);

animals.by_name = animals:sort_by("name");
```

### The Yield Operator

Whale has flexible syntax. The following block will print the same thing three
times by passing a raw string to a macro.

```whale
output "hiya";
output("hiya");
"hiya" :: input:output;
```

This block assigns a variable and prints its value three times; first with
a simple macro call, then using method syntax and finally by using the  **yield
operator: `::`**.

```
message = "hiya";

output message;
message:output;
message :: input:output;
```

Like a pipe in bash, zsh or fish, the yield operator evaluates the expression
on the left and passes it as input to the expression on the right. That input is
always assigned to the **`input` variable** for that context. These expressions
may simply contain a value or they can call a macro or function that returns
a value.

```whale
download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/characters"
    :: input:get(4)
```

This can be useful when working on the command line but to make a script easier
to read or to avoid fetching the same resource multiple times, we can also
declare variables. You should use `::` and variables together to write short,
elegant scripts.

```whale
json = download "https://api.sampleapis.com/futurama/characters";
characters = from_json(json);
names = characters:select("name");
output(names:get(4));
```

### Functions

Functions are first-class values in whale, so they are assigned to variables
like any other value. The function body is wrapped in single parentheses. To
call a function, it's just like calling a macro: simply pass it an argument or
use an empty set of parentheses to pass an empty value.

The **`input` variable** represents whatever value is passed to the function when
called.

```whale
say_hi = 'output "hi"';
add_one = 'input + 1';

assert_eq(add_one(3), 4);
say_hi();
```

This function simply passes the input to the shell's standard output.

```whale
print = 'input:output';
```

Because functions are stored in variables, we can use collections like maps to
organize them.

```whale
math.add = 'input.0 + input.1';
math.subtract = 'input.0 - input.1';

assert_eq(math.add(2, 2), 4);
assert_eq(math.subtract(100, 1), 99);
```

### Time

Whale can record, parse and convert time values. Whale can parse TOML datetime
values or can create time values using macros.

```whale
dob = from_toml("1979-05-27T07:32:00-08:00")

output "Date of birth = " + dob:local();
```

```whale
time = now();

output "Universal time is " + time:utc();
output "Local time is " + time:local();
```
